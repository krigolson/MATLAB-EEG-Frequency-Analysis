    %   The output data is in power (amplitude squared)
    
    %   create a Hanning Window to reduce edge artifacts - divide by two to get
    %   half a cosine cycle - the discontinuity from edge artifacts is
    %   because the start and end voltages of the segment are different
    %   Mike Cohen says to turn off the Hanning Window
    %   hanning_window = [];
    %   hanning_window = 0.5 - cos(2*pi*linspace(0,1,length_of_data))/2;
    %   convolute the data with the hanning window
    %   tapered_data = trimmedEEG.data .* hanning_window;
    
    % note, we are do not demean the data as in principle this is captured
    % at 0Hz which measures the DC offset. Further, if the data has been
    % filtered before FFT then the mean has already been removed.
    
    % added some varargin to allow for hamming, hanning, demean, and
    % upperbound, set the first varargin to 0 for no tapered window, to 1
    % for a hamming window, and to 2 for a hanning window. Set the second
    % varargin to 1 to demean the data or 0 to not do this. Finally, the
    % last varargin specifies the frequecy to chop the data at for cleanup
    % purposes.

    power = abs(power);

    % square the amplitude to get power
    power = power.^2;

    % multiply by 2 to ensure that the positive aspect of the fft output
    % has been corrected for the loss of the negative aspect, NB, Mathewson
    % does not do this
